# EasyMelanoScan
The repository for the app EasyMelanoScan built by Mehul K. Biala, an 8th Grader at Challenger School Berryessa. Contains both app and machine learning code.
The app uses PyTorch for machine learning and Flutter for app development.
The final goal for the app was to detect whether a mole was benign or malignant.
## The app achieved an accuracy of 93%!

### Notes
All the app code is in the `lib` folder. All the machine learning code is in the `ml` folder.
When cloning the repository, make sure to add a `tflite` file to the assets folder. If the name is not `vgg16.tflite`, make sure to change this in the code as well.
Make sure to run the install.bat file as well.
